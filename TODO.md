## Planck
1. <s>done</s> Replaced all `KC_TRNS` with `_______` (seven underscores) for readability.
2. <s>done</s> Changed the position of pageUp/Dn and Home/End buttons, to have the more used Home and End at the index and middle fingers like up/down.
3. <s>done</s>Move the toggled movement-only layer to 1, so that either:
    * all other layers can be used on top if necessary (except the L0 qwerty).
    * or touching the key for any other layer will turn off the toggled movement layer without having to do L2+L3+bkspc again (actually preferable).
4. Figure out how to make underscore usable with CapsWord, will it be possible?

## Minila
